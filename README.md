Some of the updates according to every change I, <a href ="https://linkedin.com/in/coviyarce"> Luis Covilla,</a> have made so far:

* Tried Materialize, but since is outdated, almost deprecated, changed the visual library
* Went for Bulma.io, since the dark theme was to my linking
    * Started with the basic hero + footer sections
    * Updated the folders and such with my logo and portfolio pdf



Stuff i need to do:

    - I need to update the logo for a better resolution
    - Also need to encrypt the pdf with a password in order not to break the NDA's
    - Continue with the rest of the changes, long way to go.
